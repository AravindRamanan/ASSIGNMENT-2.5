1)cluster:
Group of independent servers (usually in close proximity to one another) interconnected through a dedicated network to work as one centralized data processing resource. Clusters are capable of performing multiple complex instructions by distributing workload across all connected servers. Clustering improves the system's availability to users, its aggregate performance, and overall tolerance to faults and component failures. A failed server is automatically shut down and its users are switched instantly to the other servers.


HADOOP CLUSTER:
* A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment. 
* Hadoop cluster is a collection of racks.

BENEFITS:

* Scalable:

Hadoop is a highly scalable storage platform, because it can store and distribute very large data sets across hundreds of inexpensive servers that operate in parallel.
* Cost effective:

Hadoop also offers a cost effective storage solution for businesses' exploding data sets. The problem with traditional relational database management systems is that it is extremely costly.
* Flexible:

Hadoop enables businesses to easily access new data sources and tap into different types of data (both structured and unstructured) to generate value from that data.Hadoop can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as log processing, recommendation systems, data warehousing, market campaign analysis and fraud detection.
* Fast:

Hadoop's unique storage method is based on a distributed file system that basically 'maps' data wherever it is located on a cluster.Hadoop is able to efficiently process terabytes of data in just minutes, and petabytes in hours.
* Resilient to failure:

A key advantage of using Hadoop is its fault tolerance. When data is sent to an individual node, that data is also replicated to other nodes in the cluster, which means that in the event of failure, there is another copy available for use.

2)RACK:
          * Rack in hadoop consists of a name node and a job tracker , n number of data nodes and task tracker and a Rack switch.
          * Hadoop master daemons obtain the rack id of the cluster slaves by invoking either an external script or java class as specified by configuration files.
          * Hadoop Rack is a set of 30 or 40 nodes physically stored close together. 
          * These nodes are connected to the same network using a switch. 
          * Similarly Hadoop cluster is a collection of racks.

RACK ARRANGEMENT IN HADOOP:
        
          
          * Rack consists of a name node and a job tracker , n number of data nodes and task tracker and a Rack switch.
          
For example

          if there are 4500 nodes,typical hadoop cluster setup would contain
* 110 different racks
* Each rack would have around 40 slave machine
* At the top of each rack there is a rack switch
* Each slave machine(rack server in a rack) has cables coming out it from both the ends
* Cables are connected to rack switch at the top which means that top rack switch will have around 80 ports
* There are global 8 core switches
* The rack switch has uplinks connected to core switches and hence connecting all other racks with uniform bandwidth, forming the Cluster
* In the cluster, you have few machines to act as Name node and as JobTracker. They are referred as Masters. These masters have different configuration favoring more DRAM and CPU and less local storage.
* The majority of the machines acts as DataNode and Task Trackers and are referred as Slaves. These slave nodes have lots of local disk storage and moderate amounts of CPU and DRAM
