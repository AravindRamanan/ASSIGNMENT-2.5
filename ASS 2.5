1)cluster:
Group of independent servers (usually in close proximity to one another) interconnected through a dedicated network to work as one centralized data processing resource. Clusters are capable of performing multiple complex instructions by distributing workload across all connected servers. Clustering improves the system's availability to users, its aggregate performance, and overall tolerance to faults and component failures. A failed server is automatically shut down and its users are switched instantly to the other servers.


HADOOP CLUSTER:
* A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment. 

BENEFITS:

* Scalable:

Hadoop is a highly scalable storage platform, because it can store and distribute very large data sets across hundreds of inexpensive servers that operate in parallel.
* Cost effective:

Hadoop also offers a cost effective storage solution for businesses' exploding data sets. The problem with traditional relational database management systems is that it is extremely costly.
* Flexible:

Hadoop enables businesses to easily access new data sources and tap into different types of data (both structured and unstructured) to generate value from that data.Hadoop can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as log processing, recommendation systems, data warehousing, market campaign analysis and fraud detection.
* Fast:

Hadoop's unique storage method is based on a distributed file system that basically 'maps' data wherever it is located on a cluster.Hadoop is able to efficiently process terabytes of data in just minutes, and petabytes in hours.
* Resilient to failure:

A key advantage of using Hadoop is its fault tolerance. When data is sent to an individual node, that data is also replicated to other nodes in the cluster, which means that in the event of failure, there is another copy available for use.
